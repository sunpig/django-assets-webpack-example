/* Example app CSS, using bootstrap 4 as its basis */


// Include theme variables *before* including the main
// bootstrap source. This is where we will set the
// basic boostrap customization variables. (This is
// a less invasive alternative to putting them into the _custom.scss
// file in the bootstrap source tree.)
@import "theme_variables";

// The gulp task sets the appropriate include path so that we can
// grab the bootstrap scss directly from node_modules
@import "bootstrap";

// Now include customizations that build *on top of* bootstrap.
@import "content";

// Import other library (s)css here
